##Background
This is the [final project](Requirements.pdf) of my C-programming course. Actually I can finish this in a easier way. However, after reading the first three chapter of *Dragon Book*, I made the decision to try to put what I learn into pratice. So it was this program, still a very simple one though.

###About Mao Language
Brother Mao, who is a living lengend of SSE, TJ Univ., found that C language is not elegant enough, so he invented Mao Language based on C language on his own.

####Syntax Elements
- Reserved words: `int, double, print`
- Identifier: **Letter** (**Letter** | **Digit**)* 
- Literals: [+|-] **Digit** 
- Legal symbols:` + - * / = ( ) , ;`

####Program Structure
- Basic element is statement.
- One line for each statement and end with semicolon. No blank lines.
- (In my implementation) All the statements can be divided into three types: Declarations, Print, Others.

####Variables
- Only primitive data types: integer(32 bit), floating point(64 bit).
- Type conversion: Implicit conversion.

####Statements
- Assignments: 
	- `Id = Expression;`
	- ` (Id) = Expression;`
- Print statements: 
	- `print(Expression);`
- Others;
	- `Expression;`

####Expressions
Expressions must be one of following cases: 

- Literals
- Identifiers
- Expressions that have unary operator as prefix
- `(Expression)`
- `Expression operator Expression`, operators can be one of these(binary operators): + - * / =

##Introduction to project

###How to compile and run
In Windows environment, you could run the makefile with GCC/G++(4.8.1 or later), after that you would get MaoLang.exe. Testcase files should be passed in as the first argument of command lines, as what is shown in demo before.

###Modules
MaoLang Interpreter mainly consists of three parts: Scanner, Parser, Storage.

####Scanner
Source code: scanner.c, scanner.h

The scanner receives a statement, a stream of characters from the main function as input, then tells the parser what kind of statement it is and delivers a processed stream of characters to the parser. Meanwhile, scanner can deal with the variables declarations.

Source code is organized as follows:

	//Scanner.c
	void scan()
	{
		if (is declarations)
		{
			check if it's legal id;
			add a new variable and initialize to zero;
		}
		else if (is print)
		{
			pass the statements to parser to get expression;
			get result of the expression;
			print the result into the stdout;
		}
		else
		{
			pass the statements to parser to get expression;
			get result of the expression;
		}
		return;
	}

####Parser
Source code: parser.c, parser.h

Parser receives a stream of characters from scanner, judges if it's a legal expression, and generates an AST. It's implemented with recursive descendent method.

To put it clearly, we can see the syntax of Mao Language in details.

#####Syntax of Mao Language
The syntax of mao language is defined as follows with BNF, for brevity, here is  the key parts:

	stmt -> assign
	
	assign -> lvalue = assign
			| lvalue = expr
	
	expr -> term + expr
		  | term - expr
		  | term

	term -> factor * term
		  | factor / term
		  | factor

	factor -> (expr)
			| num
			| id

	lvalue -> id
			| (id)


#####Abstract Syntax Tree

- The type of the tree node:

		typedef struct _expression
		{
			double result;
			struct _expression* left_expr;
			struct _expression* right_expr;
	
			bool is_int;
			bool is_float;
			bool is_variable;

			int sign;
			void* value;
			char* varname;
			char operat;
		} Expression;

- The AST is generated by a series functions named `GetXXX()`. Here is the   pseudocode example for `GetExpr()`

		Expression* GetExpr(char*& input_string)
		{
			New a tree node _expr;
			Try to get a term;
			
			while (1)
			{
				if (operator is "+" or "-")
					get _operator;
				else
					break;

				if (_operator exists)
				{
					if (the term exists)
					{
						New a tree node;
						set newnode.left = _expr;
						set newnode.right = GetTerm();
						set newnode.opeartor = _operator;
						_expr = newnode;
					}
					else
					{
						return NULL;
					}
				}
			}
			
			return _expr;
		}

	
	The other functions are similar with this, you can check them out in the parser.c .

- After parsing we can get an AST,

	For instance, `a = 1 + 2 * 4`, looks like that:

	![AST Example](Img/AST.JPG)
	
	It should be noted that the `expression, term, factor...` is not really a node of the tree in practice, it's just the process of analysis instead. Once we have this tree, we can easily get the result of the expressions by doing postorder traversal.


####Variables storage
Source code: trie.c, trie.h .

For each variable there is a name, a type, and a value. The structure "trie tree" is useful here. It's not too difficult to implement and it has good properties as well. That is, by merging the same prefix of the variables' names, plenty of memory can be saved. Moreover, the time cost of searching a certain variables is reduced remarkbly. 

#####The definition of the node of trie

	typedef enum _nodetype
	{
		none, int_var, float_var, num_const
	} Nodetype;

	typedef struct _node
	{
		struct _node *child[LETTER_DIGIT_MAX];
		char node_char;
		Nodetype type;
		void* value;
	} Trienode;


####Others

Manipulate.c, manipulate.h are useful functions for string manipulation in this project.

Stdafx.h includes the header file of C standard libary.


###Story behind

 Every course project is a chance for me to learn something new and also a challenge; this one is no exception. 

At first glance the problem seemed puzzling -- a language executer? I just considered it as a compiler or a interpreter at the very beginning, so I spent two weeks reading books and finding materials about how to construct a simple compiler. I knew it's unnecessary to build a real compiler to meet the demand, but I still want to try because I thought it was not so difficult. Yet it turned out that I was too naive.

By then three-quarters of December had already passed. There's no time for me to waste. I started to code, tried to solve the problem in the simplest way first to implement the basic functions, that is, to satisfy the simple cases.

It was a bright, sunny day, the last Saturday of December. After eight hours of work, without stopping, I finished the variable declaration and storage part. I learn the data structure called "Trie Tree" with the help of Internet and it's not so hard to understand or implement that.  

Surprisingly, my thoughts became clearer the next day. It makes sense that using methods of parsing, namely, syntax analysis, to get things done. So, in the light of the textbook and materials on the Internet, I writed my "arithmetic calculator", which is able to deal with a input with operators "+-*/". Then I tried to add assign operation "=" and the unary operators "+-" based on the "calculator". This is another eight-hour job, maybe longer, and it's absolutely tougher than what I did on Saturday. 

Whatever, my own "Mao language executer" came out eventually with a whole weekend of hard work, though it's still a very simple one. Then on Monday and Tuesday I went on fixing some bugs and did the rest things like writing the makefile and this documentation.

If you ask me what I've learned these days, I would rather tell you it is taking action that helps me getting rid of anxiety. I was worried about whether I am able to finish the project on time from the time I got the assignment till the instance I started to code. Of course, it's also important that I know to how to learn something completely new for me independently with the aid of Internet.

Moreover, I found it interesting to learn about compilers, and indeed it helps me to understand how the code I write functions. Maybe in my spare time I would improve my little "Mao language executer" to a real mini C compiler, if I can.
